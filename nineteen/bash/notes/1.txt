# echo $1
# does not work; when contents are cat-ted in, each line would be assigned to
# a separate shell var.
# cat data into this script, which will be waiting for it

# so this input needs to be processed as data, once, and cannot be mutated.
# bash does int math only
# also, does not return values, just exit codes
# all variables are global by default; yay!
